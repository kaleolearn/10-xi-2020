14:11 So, all I know is that creating repositories makes those little dark green thingies on the contribution graph thingy. I literally have NO IDEA what the heck to do with this. I barely even know what a repository is. Btw, when i said "heck" earlier in this description, I initially typed "hell" but I remember that I told myself I was going to try to swear on this github thing since I already swore a bunch on my code journal. So, I'm gonna keep this as clean as possible. Anyways, I barely know what repository means, but if that's what gives me the dark green squares for now, then it's good enough for me. Until I figure out what else to create, this is what you're getting. So, my apologies.
